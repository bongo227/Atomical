# Furlang: An investigation into modern programming languages and compilers

## Analysis

In this investigation the aim is to design a programming language and implement the basics of a compiler to create executable programs. Due to the time constraints it would be infeasible to implement all asspects of a modern programming language, standard library and language tooling. Instead the focus wull be on implementing a small subset such that simple algorithums like the greatest common divisor and bubble sort can be created.

### Research
In terms of the languages design I looked at several languages with similar goals as mine and read through their specifications including: [Rust<sup>[1]</sup>](#1), [Go<sup>[2]</sup>](#2), [D<sup>[3]</sup>](#3) and [F#<sup>[4]</sup>](#4). I looked at their syntax and the design disicions behind them in order the judge what Fur should look like.

### Syntax
Compared to C modern programming languages use a lot less characters to describe the instructions which make the final program. By using less character it becomes alot faster to read through the source code in order to understand the logic, which intern makes the language easier to use and faster to develop in. With Fur, I wanted to explore some of these modern ideas and how they can be implemented. 

#### Type inference
In go, most varibles dont need a type because their type can be infered:
```go
foo := 123
```
In this case foo will be an `int` type since the value on the right hand side is an integer. If you want to be more explicit you can use the longer form varible declaration:
```go
var foo int = 123
``` 
The infered type is much quicker to type and just as easy to read, healping to reduce the character count of the source code. 

#### Semicolons and parentiesis
Most languages use semi colons to tell the compiler that the current statement has ended and everyting after the semicolon is interpreted as a seperate statment. In more modern languages like python, their are no semicolons anywhere in the language. Instead python uses spaces and new lines to signify the start and end of each statement and block.

Go uses semicolons only in a few places such as for loops:
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {}
```
Here each part of the for loop is seperate by semicolons just like C, however for most statements new lines are used as in python to signify the end of a statement.

Another thing to note is the lack of parentiesis around the for loop. The lack of brackets helps to further eliminate useless syntax which only hinders the programmer. The side effect of ommiting semicolons and brackets is that the source code is much more complex to parse since the compiler must insert semicolons before the syntax can be parsed (or use some other method to deal with the lack of semicolons).

#### Function definitions
I decided to create my own syntax for function definitions inspired partly by functional programming languages. 
```
proc bar :: int foo -> float
```
The double semi colon is used to provide a clear divider between the name and the arguments, this clear line of seperation helps when skimming though the source code in order to find a function with a certain name. Also the arrow that seperates the arguments and return type reinforces the consept of a function, to take input and transform it into output.

#### Keywords
Golang has [25 keywords<sup>[2]</sup>](#2) which helps make it's easy/quick to learn, simple to read and less keywords are reserved so it's simpler to name some constructs. The obvious drawback is the reduced expressiveness compared to languages like C# and Java which have many more keywords. Fur will be closer to Go in terms of the small pool of keywords in favor of a more simpler and clearer expression of logic.

#### Symbols
Functional languages like F# tend to use far more symbols to express their logic. Symbols make smaller code and less visual noise however they create a steeper learning curve since they are less descriptive and often unique to each language. Fur should feel familiar, sharing most of the symbols from C based languages.

#### Operator overloading
C++ and Java both have operator overloading which makes their source code easy to read in code bases that use things like arbitrarily wide integers, vectors and matrices with complex mathmatical operations. The problem is operator overloading is easily abused by hiding complex computations behind a simple looking operator. For example in the case of a two arbitrary length integers being multiplied, memory allocations and complex loops are invoked which isn't obvious from the call site. To help to programmer reason about the performance and create fast efficent code fur will opt for no function overloading.

#### Syntax objectives
* Parse the definition syntax
  * Functions definitions such as `proc add :: int a, int b -> int`
* Parse the statement syntax
  * Declaration statements
    * In standard form such as `var int foo = 100`
    * With type inference such as `foo := 100`
  * Assignment statements such as `foo = 123`
  * Binary statements
    * `+` (addition operator)
    * `-` (subtraction operator)
    * `*` (multiplication operator)
    * `/` (division operator)

    * `>` (greater than operator)
    * `>=` (greater than or equal to operator)
    * `<` (less than operator)
    * `<=` (less than or equal to operator)
  * Return statements such as `return foo`
  * Block statments such as `{ foo := 100 }`
  * If statments such as `if foo > 100 {}`
  * For statments such as `for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {}`
* Parse the expression syntax
  * Literal expressions
    * Integers such as `123`

    * `-` (minus operator)
  * Index expressions such as `foo[12]`
  * Call expressions such as `foo(1, 43)`
  * Array expressions such as `{1, 2, 3}`
  * Array types such as `int[4]`
  * Integer types:
    * `i8` (8 bit integer)
    * `i16` (16 bit integer)
    * `i32` (32 bit integer)
    * `i64` (64 bit integer)
    * `int` (platform specific fastest integer)
  * Float types:
    * `f32` (32 bit float)
    * `f64` (64 bit float)
    * `float` (platform specific fastest float)

### Memory Managment
When a program needs memory to persist longer than the scope of a function, memory needs to be allocated from the heap. The heap is slower than stack but the program can choose at run-time how much memory it wants. This flexibility brings several problems such as: what if the operating system can't give you the memory you requested, what if you need more, what if the you never give it back. In languages with manual memory management the programmer must solve all these problems whenever they need to allocate memory on the heap, making the code more complex and error prone.

One solution to this problem is a garbage collector. In languages such as Go and Java the run-time allocates blocks of memory, whenever the program requests memory a portion of that block is returned. The run-time then keeps track of where the memory is used, when the portion of memory is no longer in use its is marked and recycled ready for the next allocation. Over time these garbage collectors have been getting faster and much more sophisticated, one consequence of this is that it can be hard to understand their behavior.

The problems arises in applications which have low latency requirements, such as games. With virtual reality and higher refresh rate monitors, games have less than 7 milliseconds to update and render the next frame. GC max pause times in Go are around [50µs<sup>[6]</sup>](#6) (with considerable CPU usage) and [50ms<sup>[7]</sup>](#7) in Java, what's worse is that they can happen at anytime causing the game to freeze and stutter. One workaround is to budget this into your frame time i.e. 5ms to update and render and 2ms for any GC pauses, this means reduced graphics, less realistic physics and simpler game mechanics. Even if you do not pause mid-frame there is still the problem of: higher read/write latency, less CPU performance and less data locality (hence less cache utilization). For this reason Fur will not have a garbage collector.

#### Objectives
 - Compile programs should have no runtime managed memory.
